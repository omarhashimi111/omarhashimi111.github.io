                Here I represent Multi Step form with Beautiful UI and UX for Registering a User with custom Loading state.
                Creating Forms are the most important part of any application and it is very important to make them user friendly and easy to use. As a Developer you will need to create alot of forms in any application you build.
                It might seem some forms in the begining but once you start creating the app you will find out you will mosty create forms only. specailly in the admin panel, Finance Team All other Business login in the backend needs Form and it is very important to make them user friendly.

                Throughout my career I have experienced creating a lot of forms for admin panels mostly and users.
                there is alot to it mosty in front-end part it should be easy to use for users and have state of pending,error and success, and also it should be responsive. the are json raw data that you send to the backend with forms and multitype-data with is for the backend to process(media type). which i will discuss about it in the backend section.
