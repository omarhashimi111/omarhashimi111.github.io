          I created a school website using WordPress for a local school. The website was designed to provide information about the school, its programs, and upcoming events. I used WordPress to build the site because wordpress is easy to use and great for blogs and content management. I created a logo for them using canvas. it was not much just wanted to work with wordpress it's great tool to have for freelancing you can create these type of websites for local business super fast. for content management type sites wordpress is the best. easy to setup and easy to use. with the help of plugins you can add more functionality to your site. It's powered by PHP backend and traditional MySQL database. Really high level framework for building websites.
