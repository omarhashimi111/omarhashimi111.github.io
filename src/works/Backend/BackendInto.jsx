        <article>
            <p>Backend development is a crucial aspect of web and software development, ensuring that applications run smoothly, securely, and efficiently. It involves working with databases, servers, and application logic to provide users with seamless experiences.</p>

            <br />

            <p>
                Backend development refers to the server-side operations of a web application or any type of applications. It is responsible for managing data, processing requests, and ensuring that the front end functions correctly. Unlike front-end development, which focuses on the user interface, backend development handles the application's logic, database interactions, and authentication mechanisms.

            <h2>Core Technologies in Backend Development</h2>

            <br />

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">1. Programming Languages</h3>
            <br />

            <p>
                Backend developers use various programming languages to build and maintain applications. Some of the most popular include:
            </p>

            <br />

            <ul className='list-disc ml-4'>
                <li><strong>JavaScript(Node.js)</strong>- Ideal for full-stack development alongside frontend technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Python(Django, Flask)</strong>- Known for its readability, extensive libraries and Scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Go</strong>- Preferred for its speed and efficiency in handling concurrent operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            {/* Databases */}

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. Databases</h3>
            <br />

            <p>
                Databases store and manage data for applications. There are two main types:
            </p>

            <br />

            <ul className='list-disc ml-4'>
                <li><strong>Relational Databases (SQL)</strong>- Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
                <li><strong>NoSQL Databases</strong>- Examples include MongoDB, Firebase, and Cassandra, which are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
            </ul>


            <br />  
            {/* APIs */}

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</h3>

            <br />

            <p>
                APIs enable communication between the frontend and backend of an application. Types of APIs include:
            </p>

            <br />

            <ul className='list-disc ml-4'>
                <li><strong>RESTful APIs </strong>- The most common, based on standard HTTP methods.</li>
                <li><strong>WebSockets </strong>- Enables real-time communication, ideal for chat applications and live update.</li>
                <li><strong>GraphQL </strong>- Allows clients to specify the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <br />  
            {/* Authentication */}

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">4. Authentication and Security</h3>

            <br />

            <p>
            Security is a critical aspect of backend development.Some best practices include:
            </p>

            <br />

            <ul className='list-disc ml-4'>
                <li><strong>Using authentication methods </strong>- JWT (JSON Web Token), OAuth, and session-based authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypting sensitive data </strong>- Using hashing algorithms like bcrypt and Argon2 for passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) </strong>- Limiting user access to specific features or data.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventing common security vulnerabilities </strong>- Such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), malicious file uploads.</li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <p>Throughout my career I have developed many full-stack applications(front-end + backend). Using different Programming Languages, different Databases , differet authentication systems. I have Implemented many APIs, in high level FrameWorks Like Django and Low level Languages Like Node.js from scratch. building these apps from Scratch equipt me with low level knowlaged of how things really work under the hood. and I have practices and create Sucure apps in the low level so it gave me the security point of view of any applications.</p>

            <br />

            <p>I will include some projects of backend here as I dont have a server and domain so I cannot reffer you  to the demo of application.</p>
