        <p className='txt-shadow-sm'>I am a self-taught Software Engineer and, Data Scientist(AI).I have expertise in multiple software fields (as software has a wide range of fields) including: full stack development and Database administration. I value honesty, hard working, constantly learning and creating reliable networks.</p>
        <br />
        <p className='txt-shadow-sm'>I am so passionate about computer science and Data Science in general. I am familiar and worked with several programing languages including: <span className='font-semibold'>C, Python, JavaScript, Bash, Go</span>. and many more technologies and Frameworks for industry standard including: <span className='font-semibold'>Docker, Git & Github, Linux Server Administration, Authentication methods...</span></p>

        <p className='txt-shadow-sm'>Thereâ€™s a joke that says a data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a
        computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician(just a joke).In fact, some data scientists are for all practical purposes : statisticians,
        while others are fairly indistinguishable from software engineers. Some are machine
        learning experts. I love Science, Statistic, Probiblities, math and physics. What an amazing time to be alive!!
